The reason I create the repository now is that I learn the theory of what I need to do by observing the Adaptive controller.

You need a Logic Level Converter 8 Channel Compatible with Arduino  
https://www.amazon.com.be/-/en/gp/product/B07NNRS8FS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1  

Not sure yet if you can use the Level converter or you need the Digital Potentiometer Modules   
https://www.amazon.com.be/-/en/gp/product/B09Z27RCLV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  
  
And an Optocoupler Insulation Board

You can use Relay module... But then you also need headset to hide the sound ;)


When you look at the back of the Adaptive you have 17 holes that you can use to simulate the device.

You need to buy 13 dual jack and 4 triple jack

Before hacking the hardware we can train on the Adaptive controller as it is the same idea less the soldering.  
I found a very good tutorial here on the topic:  
https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-adaptive-game-controllers?view=all  


I saw a video about someone removing a hack of the Xbox button.

-----------------------

After opening an old xbox 360. I realize that it will be easy for button but for joystick that an other level to learn.
But this video of how to unsolder the joystick and trigger is a start.

---

Note: I through it was a good idea to hack a x360 controller to play on the Xbox...
But then realized that Xbox is not allowing old controller. That the gimick and why you need Brook at start of the adventure.
So you need to open a Xbox one to play on xbox one... And that an other level of sufffering .

If all hack key like brook are ban. Why not but else it don't worst it.
Except for the lol and the learning.

I learn today that Arduino and Raspberry Pi Pico don't have analog out pin :o  
Apparently we ave PWM that simualte it a bit but is not good enough...  
Making my plan to user shift level impossible.  
  
Fortunaltely I bought some Digital pot so I will use that.  
  
I fall on a cool forum post of someone doing the same stuff as us:  
https://forum.arduino.cc/t/control-an-xbox-360-controller-analog-stick/84233  

He used some sand paper for the soldering on the pad that I did not succeed to solder.  

Some guy said to him that he can use that instead of pot if he want to be precise:  
22€ Quality pot AD5206 Digital Potentiometer   
5-8€ Medium pot:  X9C104 100 https://www.amazon.com.be/dp/B09Z27RCLV?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details  
1.5€ minimum version of pot = https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10613  
  


 X9C103S  

Very instructive video

----------------------


From what I read.
My drone controller use 5.2k ohm resistor
And the Xbox use 10ko resistor.
So the X9C104 I bought are no the good one.
I should use the X9C103

Ok big note.
  
I realized that Octocoupler isolation board are not to be use as relay but as a votlage reader.  
So the current going in the output is like 0.03 mamp with 3.3 volt swithc.  
It was enough for the Xbox to read the input but not for a drone controller.  
Octocoupler  https://amzn.to/3Xt2sRP  

If you want to be sure that the button behave you will need a real relay.  
I have some classic relay but it make sound. https://amzn.to/3NNgpa5  
  
So if you want to hack controller without the sound and with 100% that it works.  
You will need a solid state realy https://amzn.to/46lwiMi  
  

Solid State Relay  8 channel
