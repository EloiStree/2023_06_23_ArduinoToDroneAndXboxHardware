In the past I wanted to control small drone from the hardware now that I need to do it for Xbox. I am exploring the possibility.


My goal here is to add to "Open Macro Input" the possibility to do QA testing on Xbox.

Simuation solution:
- Software with the Window Compagnon App that allows any PC controller (Use XOMI)
- Software/Hardware with a Brook key and an Arduino Micro (Use OMI with serial message)
- Hack offcial by using adaptive controller and Arduino through "relay" (use 2023_06_22_XboxAdaptiveToX360)
- Hack offcial by using adaptive controller and two Circuit Python Board HID (use 2023_10_20_CircuitPythonToX360)
- Hack hardware official by soldering on controler. (That was we are working on in here).

I want to learn to hack two type of controller.
The X360 one  and  the Drone toy one.
