Ok big note.
  
I realized that Octocoupler isolation board are not to be use as relay but as a votlage reader.  
So the current going in the output is like 0.03 mamp with 3.3 volt swithc.  
It was enough for the Xbox to read the input but not for a drone controller.

If you want to be sure that the button behave you will need a real relay.  
I have some classic relay but it make sound. https://amzn.to/3NNgpa5  
  
So if you want to hack controller without the sound and with 100% that it works.  
You will need a solid state realy https://amzn.to/46lwiMi
