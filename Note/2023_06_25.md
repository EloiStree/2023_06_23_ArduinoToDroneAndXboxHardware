I learn today that Arduino and Raspberry Pi Pico don't have analog out pin :o  
Apparently we ave PWM that simualte it a bit but is not good enough...  
Making my plan to user shift level impossible.  
  
Fortunaltely I bought some Digital pot so I will use that.  
  
I fall on a cool forum post of someone doing the same stuff as us:  
https://forum.arduino.cc/t/control-an-xbox-360-controller-analog-stick/84233  

He used some sand paper for the soldering on the pad that I did not succeed to solder.  

Some guy said to him that he can use that instead of pot if he want to be precise:  
22€ Quality pot AD5206 Digital Potentiometer   
5-8€ Medium pot:  X9C104 100 https://www.amazon.com.be/dp/B09Z27RCLV?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details  
1.5€ minimum version of pot = https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10613  
  


 X9C103S
