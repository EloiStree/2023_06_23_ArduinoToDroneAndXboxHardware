I learn today that Arduino and Raspberry Pi Pico don't have analog out pin :o
Apparently we ave PWM that simualte it a bit but is not good enough...
Making my plan to user shift level impossible.

Fortunaltely I bought some Digital pot so I will use that.

I fall on a cool forum post of someone doing the same stuff as us:
https://forum.arduino.cc/t/control-an-xbox-360-controller-analog-stick/84233

He used some sand paper for the soldering on the pad that I did not succeed to solder.

Some guy said to him that he can use that instead of pot if he want to be precise:
22€ Quality pot AD5206 Digital Potentiometer 
5-8€ Medium pot: 
1.5€ minimum version of pot = https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10613
