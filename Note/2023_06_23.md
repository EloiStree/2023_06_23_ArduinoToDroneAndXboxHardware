The reason I create the repository now is that I learn the theory of what I need to do by observing the Adaptive controller.

You need a Logic Level Converter 8 Channel Compatible with Arduino

Not sure yet if you can use the Level converter or you need the Digital Potentiometer Modules

And an Optocoupler Insulation Board

You can use Relay module... But then you also need headset to hide the sound ;)


When you look at the back of the Adaptive you have 17 holes that you can use to simulate the device.

You need to buy 13 dual jack and 4 triple jack

Before hacking the hardware we can train on the Adaptive controller as it is the same idea less the soldering.  
I found a very good tutorial here on the topic:

I saw a video about someone removing a hack of the Xbox button.
